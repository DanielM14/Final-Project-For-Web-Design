    <p>There are many great athletes who made them selves great by hard work and dedication. These are the top five NFL players of all time with some of their stats along with pictures.</p>

      <h1>RB Jim Brown -- Clevelabd Browns, 1957-1965</h1>
    <img src="images/jim.jpg" alt="The Jim Brown">
    <p>Forty years after his shocking retirement at the peak of his career, and now only seventh on the all-time rushing list, Brown still ranks as the standard against which all other running backs are measured.</p>

      <h1>WR Jerry Rice -- 49ers, Raiders, Seahawks, 1984-2004</h1>
    <img src="images/jerry.jpg" alt="The Jerry Rice">
    <p> Rice's work ethic was, and still is at 41, unparalleled and that's a major reason why he's one of the greatest players in the history of the NFL. He not only made big catches in the games that didn't matter, he also made them when the games mattered.</p>

      <h1>QB Joe Montana -- 49ers, Chief, 1979-1994</h1>
    <img src="images/joe.jpg" alt="The Joe Montana">
    <p> Montana might not have been the prototypical quarterback, but he found ways to win and was arguably the best fourth-quarter quarterback in the history of the game. If I had to start a team with a proven winner, it would probably start with Montana.</p>

      <h1>RB Walter Payton -- Bears, 1975-1987</h1>
    <img src="images/walter.jpg" alt=" The Walter Payton">
    <p>In 13 seasons, many of them played with a subpar Bears team, the man known as "Sweetness" missed just one start. What he missed even more rarely was any kind of crease through which he could slither. </p>

      <h1>LB Lawreence Taylor -- Giants, 1981-1993</h1>
    <img src="images/taylor.jpg" alt="">
    <p>He recorded 132.5 career sacks in 13 seasons with the New York Giants - a quaint number by today's standards set by Bruce Smith and Reggie White - but don't let the numbers fool you. Lawrence Taylor revolutionized the art of sacking the quarterback. </p>
